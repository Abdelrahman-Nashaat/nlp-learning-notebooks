#  Introduction to NLP – Hands-on Learning

Welcome to my personal version of the **Introduction to NLP** course repository!

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks that I used while learning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** through the excellent course by 365 Data Science / Udemy.

My goal was to get hands-on experience by applying each concept step-by-step and documenting my journey.

##  Based On

This notebook series is based on the course:
-  [Introduction to NLP on 365 Data Science](https://learn.365datascience.com/courses/nlp)
-  [Intro to NLP on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/intro-to-natural-language-processing-in-python-for-ai/)

All credit goes to the original course authors – I just customized and applied the material in my own environment.
